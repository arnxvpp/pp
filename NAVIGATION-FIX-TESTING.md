## Debugging

### If Dropdown Still Doesn't Work:

1. **Check Browser Console:**
   - Press F12 to open DevTools
   - Look for the message: "Navigation dropdown fix loaded successfully"
   - If missing, the JavaScript file didn't load

2. **Verify Files Loaded:**
   - In DevTools, go to Network tab
   - Reload the page
   - Check that both files loaded (200 status):
     - `navigation-dropdown-fix.js`
     - `navigation-dropdown-fix.css`

3. **Check for JavaScript Errors:**
   - In Console tab, look for any red errors
   - Common issues:
     - "$ is not defined" = jQuery not loaded
     - "Syntax error" = conflict with other scripts

4. **Inspect Element:**
   - Right-click "Research" link
   - Select "Inspect" or "Inspect Element"
   - Check if `<ul>` sibling exists inside the `<li>`
   - When clicked, verify these classes get added: `select fadeInUp`

### Common Issues:

**Issue:** Dropdown appears but immediately closes
- **Cause:** Click event bubbling
- **Check:** Look for `e.stopPropagation()` in the console
- **Fix:** Already implemented in our script

**Issue:** Dropdown doesn't animate
- **Cause:** CSS animations not loading
- **Check:** In DevTools > Elements, verify `.fadeInUp` class has animation property
- **Fix:** Clear browser cache and reload

**Issue:** Works on desktop but not mobile
- **Cause:** Media query not triggering correctly
- **Check:** Console log shows correct `isMobile()` value
- **Fix:** Already handled with multiple detection methods

## Success Criteria

The fix is successful when:

✅ Clicking "Research" shows/hides the dropdown menu
✅ All parent menu items with submenus work correctly
✅ Animations are smooth (fade in/out)
✅ Works on both desktop (>768px) and mobile (≤768px)
✅ Clicking outside the menu closes dropdowns
✅ No JavaScript errors in console
✅ Works across all major browsers
✅ Touch events work properly on mobile devices

## Performance Notes

- JavaScript file is lightweight (3.2KB)

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to remove the fix:

1. Remove from all HTML files:
   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" media="all" href="css/navigation-dropdown-fix.css" />
   <script src="js/navigation-dropdown-fix.js"></script>
   ```

2. Delete these files:
   - `/css/navigation-dropdown-fix.css`
   - `/js/navigation-dropdown-fix.js`

3. Clear browser cache and reload

## Support

If issues persist after testing:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify jQuery is loaded (required dependency)
3. Ensure no other scripts are blocking click events
4. Test with browser extensions disabled
5. Try in incognito/private mode to rule out cache issues
